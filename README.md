FSESS Compatibility: v11.0.0+

## SETUP
- Place the 4 LCDs and name them: "Race Main LCD", "Race Laps LCD", "Race Fastest Laps LCD",  "Race Speedtrap LCD";
- Place the "Start/Finish Sensor", and each of the checkpoint sensors: "Checkpoint Sensor 1", "Checkpoint Sensor 2";
- Place the "Pit Entry Sensor" and the "Pit Exit Sensor";
- Place the start lights and create a group for each of the countdown: "Start Lights 1", "Start Lights 2", ..., "Start Lights 5";
- Optionally you can have the green lights in a group called: "Start Lights Go";
- You can also have a LCD group to display leader's lap count.

You can always have more or less checkpoints, start lights and laps, you just need to set this up on the script variables.
